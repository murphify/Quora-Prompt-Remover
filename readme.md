# Quora Prompt Remover

> A chrome extention to remove the login prompt for Quora whenever you go onto their site lol.

Quora is gross, so you have to login to an account to use the site unless you append " ?share=1 " to the end of a URL. Super annoying lol.
This is a compilation of stackoverflow code, and I barely did anything myself. I did, however, learn a little
about onBeforeRequest & JavaScript. Go me I guess lol.


## Installation

Gotta install manually, didn't upload to the Web Store because I'm lazy lol. [How to Install Extentions Manually](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/)
